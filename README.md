## Notes

During Playwright instalation this message was shown:

```You are using a frozen webkit browser which does not receive updates anymore on mac12. Please update to the latest version of your operating system to test up-to-date browsers.```

So because of that hardware limitation, I have disabled the webkit execution in ```playwright.config.ts```
